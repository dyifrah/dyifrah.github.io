                  <p class="insetText">Turkey is a fantastic country to visit. With attractions as diverse as the many historical sites of Istanbul, to the seaside resorts on the Aegean and Mediterranean seas, there is something for everyone to enjoy. The Hagia Sofia, first constructed in 537, and the famous Blue Mosque (pictured), are two must-sees for any visitor to the super-city of Istanbul. The ornate mosaics are a sight to see.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Highly suggested is a ferry ride along the Bosphorous Strait, the dividing line between the Europe and Asia. It offers breathtaking views of the city. Istanbul is also known for its nightlife, and there are dozens of historic taverns where you can enjoy a beer, or perhaps the classic Turkish anise-flavored alcoholic drink, Raki (think ouzo, only more gross).
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Be aware of cultural norms and don't step too far out of your lane. Also, don't do drugs. If you haven't seen the movie Midnight Express, maybe pop that in the night before your flight.
